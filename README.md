This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline that takes in NBA games this season, stores it in a relational database, and uses machine learning to predict if an upcoming NBA game will be competitive. 

We will define a competitive game as having the final score differential <= 5 points.

#Motivation
With so many games going on during the season, fans want to watch games that are competitive and fun. Having an increasing number of "blow-out" games this season has made some fans not be as engaged as other seasons. This projects explores whether we can explore past games and team statistics/matchups to determine if a game will be worth watching.
